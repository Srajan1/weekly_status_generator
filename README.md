# Weekly Status Generattor

Writing weekly status mails isn't a task which most people look forward too. It's a sample project which will take and manage daily logs for you and use an LLM to generate the email body for you.

## Note: For now it's a tool which developers can run locally on their system, hence there is not authentication/authorization done. Anyone using this tool will have access to all the tasks ðŸ«¶

## LLM info
This tool uses phi3:3.8b LLM https://ollama.com/library/phi3 the model runs locally on the server and hence is completely free. The performance of the LLM will depend on the machine running it. The model was chosen because it was lightweight and has been found good for the tasks of summarization.
